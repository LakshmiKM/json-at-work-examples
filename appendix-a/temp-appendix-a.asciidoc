[[install-json-tools-in-the-browser]]
Install JSON Tools in the Browser
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[install-jsonview-in-chrome-and-firefox]]
Install JSONView in Chrome and Firefox
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

JSONView pretty-prints JSON in Chrome or Firefox. Please follow the
installation instructions on the http://jsonview.com/[JSONView site] for
your browser.

[[jsonlint]]
JSONLint
^^^^^^^^

Use http://www.jsonlint.com[JSONLint] to validate JSON documents online.

[[install-postman]]
Install Postman
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Postman provides the ability to fully test a RESTful API. It can send
HTTP `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` requests and set HTTP Headers.
You can install Postman as a Chrome extension or as a standalone GUI
application on Mac OS X, Linux, or Windows. Please visit the
https://www.getpostman.com/[Postman site] for installation instructions.

[[install-jsonpad]]
Install JSONPad
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can download JSONPad from the
https://code.google.com/p/json-pad/downloads/list[JSONPad Downloads
page]. JSONPad in its current form runs on Adobe AIR, which requires a
separate install. You can download Adobe AIR at:
https://get.adobe.com/air.

Unfortunately, Google Code is shutting down due to the popularity of
GitHub, so I recently exported this project to
https://github.com/tmarrs/json-pad[my own `json-pad` GitHub Repository]
to preserve the codebase. My hope is to eventually re-platform this
excellent tool from Adobe AIR to http://nwjs.io[NW.js (formerly known as
Node Webkit)] so that it will run as a cross-platform compatible GUI.
But this effort will have to wait until the book is published.

[[install-node]]
Install Node
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This book uses Node.js version
https://nodejs.org/en/download[`v6.10.2`], which is the current latest
stable version as of this writing.

[[install-node.js-on-mac-os-x-and-linux-with-nvm]]
Install Node.js on Mac OS X and Linux with NVM
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Although you could use the installation package from the
https://nodejs.org[Node.js site], it's difficult to change versions.
Instead, let's use https://github.com/creationix/nvm[NVM (Node Version
Manager)]. NVM makes it easy to install/uninstall Node.js, and upgrade
to newer versions.

[[install-and-configure-nvm]]
Install and Configure NVM
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

First, install NVM by using one of the following methods:

* https://github.com/creationix/nvm#install-script[Install Script]
* https://github.com/creationix/nvm#manual-install[Manual Install]

Next, let's make sure that NVM runs properly. Source it from a shell as
follows: `source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh` Now NVM will work properly for the
remainder of the installation process.

If you're running bash, then do the following file to so that NVM is
automatically sourced (i.e., configured) upon login. If you're running
bash, then do the following:

* In `$HOME/.bashrc`, add these lines:
`source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh export NVM_HOME=~/.nvm/v6.10.2`
* In `$HOME/.bashrc_profile`, add this line:
`[[ -s $HOME/.nvm/nvm.sh ]] && . $HOME/.nvm/nvm.sh # This loads NVM`

Please note that similar steps apply to Bourne Shell or Korn Shell.

[[install-node-with-nvm]]
Install Node with NVM
+++++++++++++++++++++

Now that NVM is installed, use it to install Node:

* Type `nvm ls-remote` to see what remote (i.e., not on your local
machine) versions of Node are available to install.
* Install version `v6.10.2` with the following command:
`nvm install v6.10.2`
* All Node versions are installed in `$HOME/.nvm`
* Set the default Node version to be used in any new shell:
`nvm alias default v6.10.2`
* Without this, neither the `node` or `npm` commands will work properly
when you exit the current shell.
* Now, exit your current shell.

From a new shell, upgrade to the latest version of npm:

-----------------
npm update -g npm
-----------------

Then, do the following health checks:

* `nvm ls` - You should see:
`...           ->  v6.10.2                system           default -> v6.10.2`
* `node -v`, which yields: `v6.10.2`
* `npm -v`, and it looks like: `4.6.1`

To see a full list of NVM's capabilities, type: `nvm --help`.

When you check out the Node.js https://nodejs.org/api/repl.html[REPL
(Request-Eval-Print-Loop)], you should see this:

--------------------
json-at-work => node
-> .exit
--------------------

[[avoiding-sudo-with-npm]]
Avoiding `sudo` with npm
++++++++++++++++++++++++

npm may require you to run as `sudo`, and this can get cumbersome and
annoying. This also can be a security risk because packages can contain
scripts, and npm is running with root privilege. To avoid this do the
following:

--------------------------
sudo chown -R $USER ~/.nvm
--------------------------

This works if you installed node with NVM (all node installations go
under that directory). This tip was inspired by Isaac Z. Schlueter from
http://howtonode.org/introduction-to-npm[How to Node].

[[avoiding-sudo-with-npm---option-2]]
Avoiding `sudo` with npm - Option 2
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Here's another way to avoid `sudo` - please see the
https://github.com/sindresorhus/guides/blob/master/npm-global-without-sudo.md[NPM
Global without Sudo Guide] provided by
https://github.com/sindresorhus[Sindre Sorhus].

[[taming-the-repl---mynode]]
Taming the REPL - `mynode`
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Out of the box, the default behavior of the REPL leaves a bit to be
desired because you 'undefined' after most lines of JavaScript, hitting
the Enter key, breathing, etc. This is due to the fact that JavaScript
functions always return something. If nothing is returned, then
'undefined' is returned by default. This behavior can be very annoying
and unproductive. Here's a sample session:

--------------------
json-at-work => node
-> Hit Enter
-> undefined

-> var y = 5
-> undefined
-> .exit
--------------------

To turn off 'undefined' in the REPL, add the following to `.bashrc` (or
your setup for Bourne or Korn Shell):

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh

...

alias mynode="node -e \"require('repl').start({ignoreUndefined: true})\""
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, exit the current shell and start a new shell. Rather than
re-defining `node`, it's safer to define a new alias (in this case,
`mynode`). This way, `node` will still work properly from the command
line and be able to run JavaScript files. Meanwhile, `mynode` serves as
your new REPL command.

----------------------
json-at-work => mynode
-> var x = 5
-> .exit
----------------------

You now have a Node REPL that does what you want - no more annoying
'undefined'. You're welcome. :smile:

[[install-node.js-on-windows]]
Install Node.js on Windows
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

NVM also works well on on Windows due to Corey Butler's
https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows[`nvm-windows`] application.
This is a port of `nvm` to a Windows environment. I successfully used
https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows[`nvm-windows`] on Windows 7.

[[install-node.js-on-windows-with-nvm-windows]]
Install Node.js on Windows with `nvm-windows`
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Here are the steps:

* Visit the
https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases[`nvm-windows`
Downloads Page]
* Download the latest `nvm-setup.zip` to your `Downloads` folder.
* Unzip `nvm-setup.zip` with your favorite Zip tool.
* Run `nvm-setup.exe`, which is a Wizard. Accept all defaults and the
MIT License agreement:
* Download to `C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Roaming\nvm`
* Click Finish when the install completes.
* This sets up the necessary environment variables to run Node on your
Windows machine.
* Ensure that NVM is on your `PATH`:
* Navigate to `Control Panel ⇒ System ⇒ Advanced System Settings`
* Click “Environment Variables” on the Advanced System Settings popup.
* `NVM_HOME` should have been added to Env Vars during install –
`C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Roaming\nvm`
* `NVM_SYMLINK` should point to `C:\Program Files\nodejs`
* Both `NVM_HOME` and `NVM_SYMLINK` should be on the `PATH`.
* Install Node with
https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows[`nvm-windows`]:
* Type `nvm list available` to get a list of available versions.
* Type `nvm install v6.10.2`
* Set the version of Node: `nvm use v6.10.2`
* Test the install: `node -v`

[[uninstall-node.js]]
Uninstall Node.js
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you have a previous installation of Node.js that isn't quite working
properly anymore, you may need to completely uninstall it from your
machine. This includes both the `node` and `npm` executables.

[[uninstall-node.js-on-mac-os-x]]
Uninstall Node.js on Mac OS X
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Uninstalls can be complicated, and credit for the Mac uninstall
instructions goes to
http://hungred.com/how-to/completely-removing-nodejs-npm/[Clay at
Hungred Dot Com]. If `homebrew` was used to install Node.js, then simply
type `brew uninstall node` at the prompt.

If you didn't use `homebrew`, do the following:

* cd to `/usr/local/lib` and delete any `node` executable and
`node_modules`
* cd to `/usr/local/include` and delete any node and node_modules
directory
* cd to `/usr/local/bin` and delete any `node` executable

You may also need to do the following:
`rm -rf /usr/local/bin/npm rm -rf /usr/local/share/man/man1/node.1 rm -rf /usr/local/lib/dtrace/node.d rm -rf $USER/.npm`

[[uninstall-node.js-on-linux]]
Uninstall Node.js on Linux
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Credit for the Linux uninstall instructions goes to
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5650169/uninstall-node-js-using-linux-command-line[Stack
Overflow] and https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/4058[GitHub]. Do the
following:

* Find the node installation by typing `which node`. Let's assume it's
at `/usr/local/bin/node`
* cd to `/usr/local`
* Execute the following:

--------------------------------
sudo rm -rf bin/node
sudo rm -rf bin/npm
sudo rm -rf lib/node_modules/npm
sudo rm -rf lib/node
sudo rm -rf share/man/*/node.*
--------------------------------

[[uninstall-node.js-on-windows]]
Uninstall Node.js on Windows
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Credit for the Windows uninstall instructions goes to
http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-windows[Team
Treehouse]. Here are the steps:

* Open the Windows Control Panel.
* Choose “Programs and Features”.
* Click “Uninstall a program”.
* Select Node.js, and click the Uninstall link.

[[install-yeoman]]
Install Yeoman
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://yeoman.io[Yeoman] consists of:

* `yo` (for Scaffolding).
* Either https://www.npmjs.com[`npm`] or https://bower.io[`bower`] (for
Package Management).
* Either http://gulpjs.com[`gulp`] or https://gruntjs.com[`grunt`] (for
the Build System).

For the code examples in this book, you'll need both
http://gulpjs.com[`gulp`] and
https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-cli[`grunt-cli`] for the Build System.
Although http://gulpjs.com[`gulp`] is used as the primary build tool,
you still need https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-cli[`grunt-cli`] to run
some of the gulp tasks.

I chose https://bower.io[`bower`] for Package Management.

Here are the installation steps:

* Install `yo`:
* `npm install -g yo`
* Test the `yo` installation: `yo --version`
* Install https://bower.io[`bower`]:
* `npm install -g bower`
* Test the `bower` installation: `bower --version`
* Install http://gulpjs.com[`gulp`]:
* `npm install -g gulp-cli`
* Test the `gulp` installation: `gulp --version`
* Install https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-cli[`grunt-cli`]:
* `npm install -g grunt-cli`
* Test the `grunt-cli` installation: `grunt --version`

Please refer to the http://yeoman.io/codelab/setup.html[Yeoman Setup
page] for more information.

[[install-the-generator-webapp-yeoman-generator]]
Install the `generator-webapp` Yeoman Generator
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Please see the
https://github.com/yeoman/generator-webapp[`generator-webapp` GitHub
page]. Install the generator as follows:
`npm install -g generator-webapp`

[[install-npm-modules]]
Install npm Modules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We use the following npm modules at the command line, so we install them
globally:

* link:#install-jsonlint[`jsonlint`]
* link:#install-json[`json`]
* link:#install-ujs-jsonvalidate[`ujs-jsonvalidate`]
* link:#install-http-server[`http-server`]
* link:#install-json-server[`json-server`]
* link:#install-jq-tutorial[`jq-tutorial`]

[[install-jsonlint]]
Install `jsonlint`
++++++++++++++++++

This is the npm equivalent of the http://ww.jsonlint.com[JSONLint site]
used to validate a JSON document. Here's the
https://github.com/zaach/jsonlint[`jsonlint` GitHub Repository].

To install: `npm install -g jsonlint`

To validate a JSON document: `jsonlint basic.json`

[[install-json]]
Install `json`
++++++++++++++

https://github.com/trentm/json[`json`] provides the ability to work with
JSON (i.e., pretty-printing, etc.) from the command line - it's similar
to http://stedolan.github.io/jq/[`jq`], but not as powerful.

To install: `npm install -g json`

Please visit the https://github.com/trentm/json[`json` GitHub
repository] for usage instructions.
https://www.npmjs.com/package/json[`json` is available as an npm
module].

[[install-ujs-jsonvalidate]]
Install `ujs-jsonvalidate`
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This is the npm equivalent of the http://jsonvalidate.com/[JSON Validate
site] used to valid a JSON document against a JSON Schema. Here's the
https://github.com/usingjsonschema/ujs-jsonvalidate-nodejs[`ujs-jsonvalidate`
GitHub Repository].

To install:

-------------------------------
npm install -g ujs-jsonvalidate
-------------------------------

To validate a JSON document: `validate basic.json basic-schema.json`

[[install-http-server]]
Install `http-server`
+++++++++++++++++++++

`http-server` is a simple Web Server that serves up files in the current
directory structure on the local host system as static content. I like
`http-server` because it has solid documentation, and the command line
options and shutdown are intuitive. Here's the
https://github.com/indexzero/http-server[`http-server` GitHub
Repository] and https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server[`http-server`
npm Repository].

To install: `npm install -g http-server` To run: `http-server -p 8081`

To access: `http://localhost:8081`

To shutdown: Press `Ctrl-C`

[[install-json-server]]
Install `json-server`
+++++++++++++++++++++

`json-server` is a stub REST server that takes a JSON file and exposes
it as a RESTful service. Here's the
https://github.com/typicode/json-server[`json-server` GitHub
Repository].

To install: `npm install -g json-server`

To run: `json-server -p 5000 ./speakers.json`

To access: `http://localhost:5000/speakers`

[[install-crest]]
Install `crest`
+++++++++++++++

Crest is a small REST server that provides a RESTful wrapper for
MongoDB. Please visit the https://github.com/cordazar/crest[Crest Github
Repository]. The Global +npm+ install would be the simplest way to
install +crest+, but this is broken. Instead, do a +git clone+ as
follows:

* `cd` to the directory where your other development projects reside.
We'll call this directory `projects`: `cd projects`
* Clone the repository: `git clone git://github.com/Cordazar/crest.git`
* Navigate to the `crest` directory: `cd crest`
* Update the `config.json` file to remove the `username` and `password`.
Of course this isn't secure, but you can re-add these fields and set
them to proper values later - just make sure that the settings match
your MongoDB password. We just want to get started quickly. The
`config.json` file should now look like this:
`{   "db": {     "port": 27017,     "host": "localhost"   },   "server": {     "port": 3500,     "address": "0.0.0.0"   },   "flavor": "normal",   "debug": true }`
* Be sure to link:#install-mongodb[install and start MongoDB] first.
* In a separate tab or command shell, start `crest` by typing
`node server` on the command line. You should see the following:

---------------------------------
node server

DEBUG: util.js is loaded
DEBUG: rest.js is loaded
crest listening at http://:::3500
---------------------------------

[[install-jq-tutorial]]
Install `jq-tutorial`
+++++++++++++++++++++

https://www.npmjs.com/package/jq-tutorial[`jq-tutorial`] is an npm
module that provides a nice `jq` tutorial from the command line. Install
it as follows:

--------------------------
npm install -g jq-tutorial
--------------------------

Then run it from the command line: `jq-tutorial`

[[install-ruby-on-rails-ror]]
Install Ruby on Rails (RoR)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are several ways to install Ruby on Rails:

* http://railsinstaller.org[Rails Installer]
* https://github.com/postmodern/ruby-install[ruby-install]
* https://rvm.io/[RVM (Ruby Version Manager)] + the `rails` gem
* https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv[+rbenv+] + the `rails` gem

[[install-rails-on-mac-os-x-and-linux]]
Install Rails on Mac OS X and Linux
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I prefer RVM because for Mac OS X and Linux because it's easy to upgrade
to switch between Ruby versions. Install RVM by visiting the
https://rvm.io/[RVM site] and following the
https://rvm.io/rvm/install[installation instructions].

Use RVM to install Ruby as follows:

* See the available versions of Ruby:

--------------
rvm list known
--------------

* Install Ruby `v2.4.0` as follows:

-----------------
rvm install 2.4.0
-----------------

* Check the Ruby version, and you should see something like this.

----------
ruby -v
ruby 2.4.0
----------

* After installing Ruby, you can install Rails as follows:

-----------------
gem install rails
-----------------

* Check the Rails version, and it should look like:

-----------------
rails -v
Rails Rails 5.0.2
-----------------

And you're done.

You can easily upgrade to new versions of Ruby and Rails by:

* Installing a new version of Ruby (2.x for example): `rvm install 2.x`
* Using the new version: `rvm use 2.x`
* Then install the `rails` gem as shown above.

[[install-rails-on-windows]]
Install Rails on Windows
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use http://railsinstaller.org[Rails Installer] for a Windows
environment, and do the following:

* Download the installer for Windows.
* Run the installer and follow the defaults.

I've used http://railsinstaller.org[Rails Installer] on Windows 7, and
it worked properly. The http://railsinstaller.org[Rails Installer] page
has excellent information on RoR tutorials and how to get help with
installation issues.

[[install-ruby-gems]]
Install Ruby Gems
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We use the following Ruby Gems outside of Rails, so we install them
globally:

* link:#install-multi_json[`multijson`]
* link:#install-oj[`oj`]
* link:#install-awesome_print[`awesome_print`]
* link:#install-activesupport[`activesupport`]
* link:#install-minitest[`minitest`]
* link:#install-mailcatcher[`mailcatcher`]

[[install-multi_json]]
Install `multi_json`
++++++++++++++++++++

https://github.com/intridea/multi_json[`multi_json`] provides a wrapper
that invokes the most common JSON gems on behalf of the caller by
choosing the fastest JSON gem that has been loaded in an application's
environment. Install it as follows:

----------------------
gem install multi_json
----------------------

[[install-oj]]
Install `oj`
++++++++++++

https://github.com/ohler55/oj[`oj`], (Optimized JSON), is considered by
many to be the fastest Ruby-based JSON processor available. Install it
as follows:

--------------
gem install oj
--------------

[[install-awesome_print]]
Install `awesome_print`
+++++++++++++++++++++++

https://github.com/awesome-print/awesome_print[awesome_print]
pretty-prints a Ruby object and is used for debugging purposes. Install
it as follows:

-------------------------
gem install awesome_print
-------------------------

[[install-activesupport]]
Install `activesupport`
+++++++++++++++++++++++

https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/master/activesupport[`activesupport`]
provides functionality that has been extracted from Rails.
ActiveSupport's JSON module provides the ability to convert keys between
camel case and snake case. Install it as follows:

-------------------------
gem install activesupport
-------------------------

[[install-mailcatcher]]
Install `mailcatcher`
+++++++++++++++++++++

https://mailcatcher.me[`mailcatcher`] is a very simple mail (i.e., SMTP)
server. It's a great tool for testing emails without forcing you to send
a real email. Install it as follows:

-----------------------
gem install mailcatcher
-----------------------

[[install-mongodb]]
Install MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please see the https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/[MongoDB
installation documentation] and follow the instructions to install and
start MongoDB on your platform.

[[install-the-java-environment]]
Install The Java Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our Java environment depends on:

* link:#install-java-se[Java SE]
* link:#install-gradle[Gradle]

[[install-java-se]]
Install Java SE
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We're using Java SE (Standard Edition) 8 for this book, so please visit
the
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[Oracle
Java SE 8 download site].

You'll see the term "JDK" (Java Developer Kit) on that page. JDK is the
old name for Java SE. Just look for "Java SE Development Kit", accept
the license agreement, and do the proper download for your operating
system. After you've downloaded and run the installer, you'll want to
setup your Java command line environment for your operating system.

Follow the instructions below for you system. Then run `java -version`,
and you should see something similar to this:
`java version "1.8.0_72" Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_72-b15) Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.72-b15, mixed mode)`

[[java-setup-on-mac-os-x]]
Java Setup on Mac OS X
++++++++++++++++++++++

In `.bashrc`, do the following to setup `JAVA_HOME` and add it to your
`PATH`: ``` ...

export
JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.x.y.jdk/Contents/Home #
x and y are the minor and patch versions

...

export PATH=...:$\{JAVA_HOME}/bin:... ```

[[java-setup-on-linux]]
Java Setup on Linux
+++++++++++++++++++

In `.bashrc`, do the following to setup `JAVA_HOME` and add it to your
`PATH`: ``` ...

export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.x.y/bin/java # x and y are the minor and
patch versions

...

export PATH=...:$\{JAVA_HOME}/bin:... ```

Then, refresh your environment: `source ~/.bashrc`

Credit for Java setup on Linux goes to
http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-unix-set-java_home-path-variable/[nixCraft].

[[java-setup-on-windows]]
Java Setup on Windows
+++++++++++++++++++++

The Java Windows Installer usually puts the JDK in one of the following

[[install-gradle]]
Install Gradle
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.gradle.org[Gradle] is used for building source and test code.
Please visit the https://gradle.org/install[Gradle Installation Guide]
and follow the instructions for your operating system. After you've
completed the installation, run `gradle -v` from the command line and
you should see something like this:

------------------------------------------------------------
gradle -v

------------------------------------------------------------
Gradle 3.4.1
------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------

On Mac OS X, I succesfully used
https://gradle.org/install#with-homebrew[Homebrew to install Gradle].

[[install-jq]]
Install `jq`
~~~~~~~~~~~~

http://stedolan.github.io/jq/[`jq`] provides JSON-based command-line
processing. To install it, just follow the
http://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/[Download instructions on the `jq`
GitHub repository].

`jq` works with and depends on link:#install-curl[`cURL`]

[[install-curl]]
Install `cURL`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

http://curl.haxx.se/[`cURL`] provides the ability to communicate over
multiple protocols, including HTTP. Use this to make HTTP calls to
RESTful APIs from the command line.

[[install-curl-on-mac-os-x]]
Install `cURL` on Mac OS X
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Just like with Linux, `cURL` may already be installed on your Mac. Check
it as follows:

--------------
curl --version
--------------

If it's already there, then there's nothing else to do. Otherwise,
you'll need to install it. I use http://brew.sh/[Homebrew] as my package
installer on Mac OS X, so use the following command to install `cURL` on
a Mac: `brew install curl`

[[install-curl-on-linux]]
Install `cURL` on Linux
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Check if `cURL` is already installed by entering the following command:

--------------
curl --version
--------------

If it isn't there, then do the foollowing from the command line:

-------------------------
sudo apt-get install curl
-------------------------

This should work on Ubuntu or Debian.

[[install-curl-on-windows]]
Install `cURL` on Windows
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To install `cURL` on Windows, do the following:

* Visit the http://curl.haxx.se/dlwiz/[`cURL` Download Wizard]
* Select the type of package: *curl executable*
* Select the Operating System: either Windows / Win32 or Win64
* Select the Flavor - either `Cygwin` (if you use
https://www.cygwin.com/[Cygwin]) or `Generic` (if you don't use
https://www.cygwin.com/[Cygwin])
* Select the Win32 Version (only if you selected Windows / Win32 above):
*Unspecified*

[[install-apache-kafka]]
Install Apache Kafka
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We use http://kafka.apache.org/[Apache Kafka] in Chapter 10 for
JSON-based messaging. Kafka depends on
http://zookeeper.apache.org/[Apache Zookeeper], so you'll need to
install Zookeeper, too. Before going any further, please be sure to
link:#install-the-java-environment[install The Java Environment] on your
machine (because Kafka is based on Java).

[[install-kafka-on-mac-os-x]]
Install Kafka on Mac OS X
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://brew.sh/[Homebrew] is the easiest way to install Kafka on Mac OS
X. Do the following from the command line: `brew install kafka`
